# market-data-bus

A small C++ message bus / market-data-engine project (CMake-based).

## Build

This project uses CMake. From the repository root:

mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Run tests / examples

After building, binaries are in the `build/` and `build/engine` subfolders.

## Add this project to GitHub

1. Make sure you have a GitHub account and an SSH key or PAT set up. See https://docs.github.com/
2. Create a new repository on GitHub ("New repository"). Do not initialize with README or .gitignore if you plan to push this repo.
3. Add a remote locally and push — example (replace with your repo URL):

```bash
# using HTTPS
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/market-data-bus.git
# OR using SSH
# git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-username>/market-data-bus.git

git branch -M main
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```

That's it! Once pushed, your code will be visible on GitHub and you can enable CI, add issues, and manage collaborators.
